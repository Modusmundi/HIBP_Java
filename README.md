HIBP - The Java implementation!

This simple little app takes your password, hashes it, and checks it against the HIBP database to determine whether or not your password has been pwned.  It does so through the K-Anonymity model (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange) so that you're not passing a password unnecessarily.

Inspired by the article "Has Your Password Been Pwned?" in the Spring 2020 2600.

It was a fun little thing to create.
